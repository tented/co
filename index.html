                   Review: the Snowpeak Spo3ck
                </div>

                    </div>
					
					<p>
						Today's i got to use the new Snowpeak Spo3ck, a titanium spork. You may have heard of it's predecessor humble called the Snowpeak Titanium Spork that has been a hit over at <a hred="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/8ace/">Thinkgeek.com</a>.
					</p>
					<p>	
						Now, here they are with a new edition of their famous spork, the Spo3ck.
					</p>	
					
					<!--the following div's content is hidden on pageload, it's article-expand.js that makes it bigger/smaller.-->
					<div class="article-hidden-section" id="hidden-article2">
											
						What sets the Spo3ck apart from it's predecessor is the addition of two extra prongs, shaped like the ears of the Star Wars character Spock, who i have been told is quite famous amongst those who do not go out camping enough.
						
						<p>
						While the resemblance to Harrison Ford's character is striking, I feel that they could have added some more detail, other than the ears, to the Spo3ck. Perhaps an eventual Spo4ck will capture the stoic nature of the character even better.
						</p>
						
						<div class="article-img-container">
							<img src="static/sporck-spock-comparison.png">
						</div>
						
						<p>
						While aesthetically pleasing, the Spo3ck is unfortunately not as enjoyable for actual eating.
						I have to be honest and admit that I'm not a big fan of sporks in general and much prefer my Titanium StrawSticks as a multi-usage eating tool.
						But even compared to regular sporks the Spo3ck is just simply harder to use, with the pointy "ears" more often than not poking you in the edges of the mouth when trying to use it.
						</p>
						<p>
						While great to look at, it simply is not as functional as it should be. And I'm sure in your life as well, functionality is key, and design takes a second place. 
						</p>
						<p>
						This spork belongs on a shelf, not in a trekking bag.
						</p>
						<p>
						Final rating:

                   Interview with Bear Grylls
                </div>

					<p><em>
						I've had the pleasure to sit down with Bear Grylls, everyone's favourite wee drinking survivalist, to discuss popular myths regarding surviving in desperate situations.
					</em></p>
						
					<h3>
					What would you consider being the most popular myth when it comes to not dying?
					</h3>
					
					<p>
						One of the most common myths is that if your car breaks down in the desert, you should walk away and try to find help. That is not a good idea, people die because of it!
					</p>
					<p>
						Thinking it's only a few miles to the nearest town, they're found dead two or three miles from their car because they underestimated how brutal and tiring the desert can be. Stay where you are, make yourself safe, and wait for rescue.
					</p>
					
					<!--the following div's content is hidden on pageload, it's article-expand.js that makes it bigger/smaller.-->
					<div class="article-hidden-section" id="hidden-article1">
						<p>
							Another polar one is that people think that because water is clear and free-running in a mountain stream, it's fine to drink it. In actuality, you don't know what's in that stream. There could be a dead animal upriver!
						</p>
						<p>
							Clear, clean looking fresh water isn't necessarily safe to drink. You should always boil water before you drink it to make sure you don't get giardiasis, which can make you throw up or give you diarrhea. Clear water isn't necessarily clean water, and beware of mountain streams.
						</p>	
						<p>	
							Finally, there is the myth is that if you're lost for any length of time, you've got to find food. That really isn't true, and you can actually survive for weeks and weeks without it. Your priorities should be finding shelter and water, especially since in most places you'll be dead in three days without water. Eating food will also dehydrate you faster, so focus on getting water before food.
						</p>
						
						<h3>
							What kind of survival myths have you fallen victim to yourself, if any?
						</h3>
						
						<p>
							I made my real mistake was when I was about 8. I was with my dad in the mountains when a storm came down, and we thought, "Oh, we know the way back down the mountain, we'll just head down." But we couldn't see where we were going and we ended up heading the wrong way.
						</p>
						<p>
							We spent the whole night wandering around, absolutely exhausted, disoriented, and very cold. Finally, by good fortune, we stumbled across a little trail and eventually found a way back. The lesson there is if there's a blizzard, don't try and beat it. Concentrate on making yourself safe and getting out of the wind; find shelter however you can. It's the same in a desert sandstorm. People push on in sandstorms thinking they can find a way out when in reality they're never going to beat it and should focus on staying sheltered and safe.
						</p>
						
						<h3>
							Which are the things that people should look the most out for?
						</h3>					
						<p>
							One of the biggest mistakes I see is when people with egos write checks their bodies can't cash. A classic example is when people get summit fever. They get close to a mountain and when they run out of time and energy, they push on even when the signs are saying they should turn back. They end up stuck in the mountain in the dark or dropping off the mountain the wrong way because they get too tired. Summit fever is a very dangerous problem; it kills people on mountains because they start breaking their own rules.
						</p>
						<p>
							Often, people make a rookie mistake by going off on their own on what they think is a simple hike, and they don't tell anyone where they're going or when they'll be back. Even a nice, easy hike can turn very ugly if you get lost or twist an ankle and no one knows you're missing or where to look for you. No matter how modest the trek, tell people where you're going and when you're due back. That way, you know that there will be help coming if you don't return.
						</p>	
						<p>
							Another dangerous rookie mistake is when people underestimate how debilitating altitude and the effects of altitude sickness can be. Everything is worse and more extreme at high altitude; you're fighting dehydration, altitude sickness, the cold, and the wind. An action that's totally straightforward to perform at sea level can become impossible at high altitude. High up in the mountains I've seen people, myself included, reduced to crawling on their hands and knees along something you'd just run up at sea level. Survival and even simple actions become much harder at high altitudes.
							Sometimes, though, you need to break your own rules and trust your instincts. A good adventurer knows when to do that and when not to. There have been times while we've been filming when it was right to push on through a storm, and then there have been times when it seemed right to follow a steep mountain ravine down a path and it actually turned out to be pretty precarious and dangerous.
						</p>
						<h3>
							Finally, what kind of advice would you want to give anyone who is going out in the wild?
						</h3>
						<p>
							You have to give yourself a large margin of error, at least in the wild. You've got to anticipate the worst, and consider that if you or someone else gets injured you need to be able to still carry out your decision. And take your time to make that decision, because the repercussions of your choices are ones that you'll be living with for a long time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ultimately, though, the best way to learn survival methods comes from seeing and doing. And if you don't want to go through the experience yourself, you can see rookies learn how to survive by trial and error and deal with the consequences of their mistakes by watching "Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls" on NBC, Monday nights at 9.

                   The first blushes of the smarttent
                </div>

                <div class="article-byline">
                    BY NORMAN CHAN ON <em>JUST NOW</em> 2013
                </div>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>
                        This past weekend I got to try out the DotShelter 386, from Capsule Corp. They are a small 3-man company (or 2-man and gear if you use the base-tent counting scheme) hailing from the capital of the Bay Area - Portland, Oregon. They are pioneers of the burgeoning smarttent movement, a fairly recent development in the techtent scene.</p>
                        <p><em>Smarttent</em> is a portmanteau of "smartphone" and "tent", and as such is a tent you keep on your smartphone. It's perfect for those of us who, between delicious Mission District burritos, feel the urge to go out in the wild for some camping. Simply open up the DotShelter app, and feel your air-conditioned living equilibrium restored!
                    </p>
                    <p>
						One of my favourite features is the ability to view your smarttent from multiple angles and in a variety of styles and shapes. My one quibble with the app is the lack of Retina support, both on iOS and as a Mac OS Dashboard widget (oh yes there's a desktop version too). The aliased edges can remove some of the realism, but the ambient weather effects more than make up for it for now.
                    </p>

                    <p>
					Keep an eye out for an updated version which will bring Android support and the ability to trade tents between your friends over an end-to-end encrypted connection.

					<p>
						This week I was able to visit the south mount Everest base in Nepal camp at an altitude of 17.569ft.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was invited there by one of our readers, and avid climber, Reinhold Messner, the first man to climb Everest without oxygen supplies in 1978, to check out how he's set up his base camp.
					</p>					
					<p>
						We will try and get Reinhold on the Tented podcast soon. 
					</p>					
					<p>
						But untill then let's discuss tents!
					</p>
					
					<div class="article-hidden-section" id="hidden-article0">
						<h3>Comfort</h3>
						<p>
							With its huge ceilings and spacious cubic design, this tent is the king of comfort. The 6'5 tall ceiling throughout the tent allows multiple people to be standing at once, and creates space in an otherwise crowded environment. This tent is also fitted with mesh walls and ceilings, allowing the tent to breathe and keep the air moving on those hot days when you just want to read in a bug-free shaded zone. The rain fly is very versatile as well. With several attachment points around the tent you are able to roll up the rain fly on the sides in the middle of the day to cool off, and easily roll them back down at night to keep the heat inside.
							The BigDome also has an internal divider in case you want a little bit of privacy every now and then. It can also be fun for kids to feel like they have their own room in the tent with their very own door, or you can use one half for all your gear and the other half as a clutter free sleeping space.
							This tent has several different accessories you can buy to make it even more comfortable. REI sells an extended vestibule that you can attach to either side called the connect tech garage. This gives you a nice awning in front of the tent, which can be nice if its raining and you want to dry off before you enter the tent, or in case you want to store extra gear.
						</p>
						<p>
						   <h3>Storm Resistance</h3>
							The Dome's barn house style frame is not ideal in high winds. If you don't take the time to properly stake out the tent and attach all guy lines, the wind will turn the tent into a dancing caterpillar. In all camping situations you should look for a wind-protected site and orient the tent so the widest part is not perpendicular to the prevailing wind. With the Kingdom 8, this is particularly important. In our testing in San Francisco (famous for high winds), we found that as long as it was staked down and had all the guy-lines out, then it was fine unless the winds were exceptionally strong.
							As for rain, this tent's rain fly covers the entire tent and will keep you dry in a storm. Although it only has one vestibule, REI sells an additional one that you can buy for about $40 to cover both doors completely. Without this extra vestibule, you want to be sure the vestibule side is oriented into the prevailing wind.
							If you are looking for a more bombproof tent that is a little less comfortable but will be able to withstand more powerful storms, then check out the Big Agnes Flying Diamond 8, Super Tenter Deluxe PRO.
							One thing tho; <span style="font-style: italic">I wish modern tents had solar panels on them. If you're stuck in a storm one would need every smidge of electricity to survive.</span> Get on it!
						</p>
						<p>
							<h3>Workmanship</h3>
							One thing that really stood out with this tent was the floor. It's made out of a 200 denier nylon material, called nylon oxford. The floor is also a bucket style that comes up about a foot on each side of the tent. The rest of the tent is also fairly durable. From the pole clips to the zippers on the doors, this tent is well made and in the seven months we've had it we haven't had a problem. You should also know that this tent doesn't come with a footprint; you have to buy one separately.
						</p>

						<div class="article-img-container-float-right">
							<img src="static/2-everest-base-camp.jpg">
						</div>

						<p>
							<h3>Ease of Setup</h3>
							The first time we set up this tent out of the bag without reading the directions we were pretty confused. This is a unique design that most people are not familiar with. But, like most things, once we practiced enough, we found the tent fairly simple to assemble. Something to note for those who aren't very tall: it may be difficult to attach the pole clips on the top of the tent and put the rain fly on without help. We also recommend that you have at least two people when setting up this tent. We were able to set it up with one person but for the safety of yourself and the tent, please do not try that. It can be very damaging to the tent poles.
							With two people, this tent took us about 15 minutes to set up and about 13 minutes to take down and put away completely.
						</p>
						<p>
							<h3>Packing Size</h3>
							This tent has the best carrying bag we've seen. REI essentially created a backpack carrying bag that is genius and makes carrying the heavy tent around a lot easier. This bag has four compartments – two big sleeves, one for the tent body, and one for the rain fly. One slot in the middle is for the tent poles, while the outer pockets hold the stakes and guy-lines.
							The Kingdom's packed size is 25 x 17 x 9.5 It's the third smallest of the tents we tested. We like the compact cube shape that is much easier to pack in a car or the garage than the long cylinder shape of most other packed tents.

						Welcome!

                    <p>
                        My long awaited debut on the tent scene is finally here! How exiting!
                        On this site I will be testing and trying out the latest and greatest in tenting. Join me on this rollercoaster of pegs, zippers, tents and tents!
